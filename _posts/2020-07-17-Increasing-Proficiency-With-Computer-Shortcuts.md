Lately I've been learning and using a lot more shortcuts on my computer than ever before, and I really benefit from them, so I figured I'd write them down. Just by implementing one of these every once in a while, you can really cut down on the amount of times you have to reach for your mouse or navigate around the screen. As my Dad said on the topic, there are lots of things that we don't know about that are right at our fingertips (how punny). Here are some of the shortcuts I use often that I think would be helpful to most people.

Also, sorry Mac users, this article is skewed towards Windows, but most of these work with command (Ctrl) and option (Alt).

## Keyboard

#### Alt + Tab

My absolute number one suggestion. Try it right now. This lets you switch to your most recently used window, and if you hold Alt after  pressing Tab, you'll see all of your current windows. By pressing Tab again, you can swap to any of them. You can quickly reference websites, switch between documents, or do something when you've forgotten what you're doing. I wish I was told about this from the moment I first touched a keyboard.

#### Ctrl + X

One classic shortcut is the old faithful Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V or copy, paste. Ctrl + X is much like Ctrl + C, but it also deletes the text after copying it, saving you from pressing backspace afterwards. In some text editors, usually ones meant for programming, if you don't have anything highlighted, it will copy and delete the line you are on, and if nothing is on the line, it will delete the line. I find this one quite helpful when I need to move a block of text somewhere else.

#### Ctrl + Z, Ctrl + Y

Undo and redo. Ctrl + X undoes recent changes you've made, in case you make an accident or just don't like something, and Ctrl + Y redoes what you have undone for when you decide that's what you wanted after all. Also, you can continue to press these for as long as the program you're in has kept track of what you've done.

#### Ctrl + F

The student's saviour, this shortcut lets you type something into a bar and it will find all the matching words or phrases. In some instances you can also use an option to replace all of those matching words with another word of your choice.

#### Ctrl + A

Highlights all of document or page you're looking at, so instead of highlighting with your mouse and scrolling down until you're at the bottom of the document, you can do it with two keys, combine this with a Ctrl + C, and you can start moving whole documents around easy peasy.

#### Ctrl + T

Opens a new tab in a web browser

## Mouse

Center clicking (clicking on the scrolly thing) on a link opens up a new tab in your browser without going to it. No more right click + scroll to the open link in a new tab + left click open link in a new tab. Sometimes there's about 5 links I want to open for later, so now I can do it in 5 clicks.

Double clicking on text selects the whole word.

Triple clicking on text selects the whole line.
